# QRS: Quick Recognition Systems

**QRS (Quick Recognition Systems)** is an end-to-end automated system designed to streamline the evaluation of handwritten exam papers in educational institutions. Built with a full-stack architecture using Python (Flask), Node.js, and MySQL, the system provides teachers with an intuitive and efficient platform for managing student submissions and automating image-based answer extraction.

## üß† Core Features

* **Image Preprocessing with OpenCV**: Converts scanned images to grayscale, performs edge detection and contour-based segmentation to automatically crop student answers.
* **Backend Orchestration**: Uses Flask for image processing APIs and Node.js for teacher/student management. Communication is handled via RESTful APIs.
* **Student Metadata Integration**: Links each answer image to student metadata (name, surname, ID) using MySQL.
* **Dockerized Deployment**: All components (Flask app, Node app, MySQL) are containerized and orchestrated via Docker Compose.
* **Authentication System**: Teacher login and student-school-class assignments managed securely with proper database relationships.

## üì∏ Sample Output

> Cropped handwritten answers are saved into uniquely named folders based on student identity and image metadata. Example file name:

```
Eslem_Tun√ß_5_answer_123_sorunun_cevabi.jpg
```

## üîê Security Notes

* Passwords are stored in plain text for demonstration. Consider using hashing (e.g., bcrypt) in production.
* CORS is enabled on all origins ‚Äî restrict this in production.
